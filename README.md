## Creating Dynamic / Editable Table using JS, HTML and JSON data. A practice for Design Pattern, HTML and JSON.
```
Assignment:
  Write a program Employee System UI which does the following:

     Sample JSON:
     let json = {"employees":[ 
     {"name":"John Smith", "email":"john.smith@xyz.com", "Title":"Finance Staff 1", "Dept" : "Finance", "Location" : "San Jose", "Mgr", "F"},
     {"name":"Bob Ford", "email":"bob.ford@xyz.com", "Title":"HR Assistant", "Dept" : "Human Resources", "Location" : "Sunnyvale", "Mgr", "F"},   
     {"name":"Tim Wray", "email":"tim.wray@xyz.com", "Title":"Vice President", "Dept" : "R&D", "Location" : "San Jose", "Mgr", "T"},
     {"name":"Don Smith", "email":"don.smith@xyz.com", "Title":"Engineering Manager", "Dept" : "R&D", "Location" : "San Jose", "Mgr", "T"},    
     {"name":"Kelly Doe", "email":"kelly.doe@xyz.com", "Title":"Software Engineer", "Dept" : "R&D", "Location" : "San Jose", "Mgr", "F"}, 
    ]}
    
    
Write a program using HTML, JQUERY, Angular(f you want to) and display the list of existing employees in a table
where you can add, edit, or delete the employee (You can only edit title, dept, and location)
Any changes should be reflect in the existing json. If the mgr field is T, then in the table, there should be link available, e.g: www.google.com. Otherwise, N/A should be  display in that field.
  ```
              

Title, Dept, Location fields are only editable. The changes made in those feild will reflect on the JSON.
 Delete row from the table with double-click. it will update JSON. 
 Add new row to the table then Save. it will update JSON.
